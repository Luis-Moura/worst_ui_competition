# Worst UI Competition

## Description
The **Worst UI Competition** is a fun and experimental React application created with Vite and Tailwind CSS. The app presents a deliberately confusing interface as a playful challenge for users. It includes features like random input order and unpredictable styling changes.

## Features
- **Dynamic Input Order:** Inputs appear in a randomized order with confusing labels.
- **Submit Button Behavior:** The app displays different messages based on the number of submissions.
- **Animated UI Elements:** Includes animations for error messages and form elements.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that provides optional type annotations and improves code quality and maintainability.
